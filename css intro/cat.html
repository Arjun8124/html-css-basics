        <p>
            The <b class="bold">cat (Felis catus)</b>, also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small
            domesticated
            carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.
        </p>
        <p>
            Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East
            around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding
            human
            contact. It is valued by humans for its companionship and its ability to hunt vermin. There are more than
            seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cat intelligence is evident in their ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems, with
            research showing they possess strong memories, exhibit neuroplasticity, and display cognitive skills
            comparable
            to a young child. Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting, and
            body
            language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small
            mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

        <h2 class="titles">TAXONOMY</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat. Felis catus
            domesticus
            was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in
            1904
            was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct
            species, namely Felis catus. In 2007, the modern domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus sampled
            worldwide
            was considered to have probably descended from the African wildcat (F. lybica), following results of
            phylogenetic research. In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the
            ICZN in
            regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus.

        <h2 class="titles">EVOLUTION</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that has a common ancestor from about 10 to 15 million
            years ago. The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45
            million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to
            16.76
            million years ago. The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago.
            Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or
            parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection. The domestic cat and
            its
            closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes.

        <h3 class="titles">Domestication</h3>
        <p>
            It was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from
            around 3100 BC. However, the earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat was excavated
            close
            by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500â€“7200 BC. Since there is
            no
            evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought
            the
            cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland. Scientists therefore assume that
            African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular
            the
            house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early
            farmers
            and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated
            cats.
            Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.
